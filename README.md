* JsPrettier


## how it works? It's simple! Follow the instructions bellow:

First of all, you need to clone this repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/gabriel-brito/starwars-catalogue.git
``` 

And then you install a local server inside the project with:

```
cd starwars-catalogue
npm install http-server -g
```

Up the server with:

And now will appear every character of StarWars series until now!
Simple, not?


## When you select your favorite character, will appear this informations:

* And who came from the same planet!

## Filter Usage:

* If nothing is written on the search field, you're going to see all StarWars characters by pressing the search button.
